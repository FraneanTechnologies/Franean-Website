        <div class="prose prose-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed max-w-none prose-red">
            <p class="mb-4">In an increasingly mobile-driven world, adopting a mobile-first design approach is no longer an option but a necessity. This strategy prioritizes designing for the smallest screens first and then progressively enhancing the experience for larger devices. Here are the core principles of mobile-first design:</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">1. Content Prioritization</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Mobile-first forces you to prioritize content. On smaller screens, every pixel counts, so you must determine the most critical information and actions. This often leads to a cleaner, more focused user experience, as unnecessary elements are stripped away.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">2. Progressive Enhancement</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Instead of starting with a desktop design and then trying to adapt it for mobile (graceful degradation), mobile-first uses progressive enhancement. You start with a solid, functional base for mobile users and then add more complex features, layouts, and visual enhancements for larger screens.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">3. Performance Optimization</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Mobile users often have slower internet connections and less powerful devices. Mobile-first design inherently encourages performance optimization, such as optimizing images, minimizing code, and reducing HTTP requests, leading to faster loading times and a better user experience on all devices.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">4. Touch-Friendly Navigation</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Designing for touch interfaces is crucial. Ensure buttons and interactive elements are large enough for fingers to tap accurately, and navigation menus are easily accessible and intuitive for mobile users (e.g., hamburger menus, sticky footers).</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">5. Fluid Layouts and Responsive Images</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Utilize fluid grid layouts and responsive images that automatically adjust to different screen sizes. This ensures that your content is always presented optimally, regardless of the device. CSS Flexbox and Grid are powerful tools for achieving this.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">6. Simplicity and Minimalism</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">A mobile-first approach naturally promotes simplicity and minimalism in design. By focusing on essential elements, you create a less cluttered interface that is easier to navigate and understand, especially on smaller screens.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">7. Accessibility Considerations</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Designing for mobile often aligns with accessibility best practices. Larger tap targets, clear typography, and logical content flow benefit all users, including those with disabilities. Consider contrast ratios and font sizes for readability.</p>

            <p class="mt-6">Embracing mobile-first design not only future-proofs your website but also ensures a superior experience for the majority of internet users, ultimately leading to higher engagement and better business outcomes.</p>
