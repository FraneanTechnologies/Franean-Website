        <h1 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-extrabold text-gray-900 leading-tight mb-6">Web Design Trends in 2024</h1>

        <div class="prose prose-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed max-w-none prose-red">
            <p class="mb-4">The digital landscape is constantly evolving, and so are web design trends. Staying updated with the latest trends is crucial for creating modern, engaging, and effective websites. Here are some of the prominent web design trends shaping 2024:</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">1. AI-Powered Personalization</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Artificial intelligence continues to play a significant role in web design, particularly in delivering personalized user experiences. AI-powered algorithms analyze user behavior to present tailored content, product recommendations, and navigation paths, making each visit unique and highly relevant.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">2. Immersive 3D Elements and Animations</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">3D elements and intricate animations are becoming more prevalent, offering users a deeply immersive visual experience. These elements add depth and interactivity, moving beyond flat designs to create a more dynamic and memorable impression.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">3. Dark Mode Dominance</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Dark mode isn't just a passing fad; it's becoming a standard feature. Offering a dark theme provides a comfortable viewing experience in low-light conditions, reduces eye strain, and often enhances the aesthetic appeal of a website, making colors pop and content stand out.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">4. Micro-interactions and Haptic Feedback</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Subtle micro-interactions, like small animations when clicking a button or hovering over an element, enhance user engagement and provide immediate feedback. Paired with haptic feedback on mobile devices, these interactions create a more tactile and intuitive experience.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">5. Glassmorphism and Neomorphism</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">These design styles continue to gain traction. Glassmorphism, characterized by frosted-glass effects and transparency, gives elements a sense of depth. Neomorphism, on the other hand, creates a soft, extruded effect, making UI elements appear as if they are part of the background, offering a subtle yet sophisticated look.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">6. Inclusive Design and Accessibility</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Web design is increasingly focusing on inclusivity and accessibility. This means designing websites that can be used by everyone, regardless of their abilities, by implementing features like high contrast modes, keyboard navigation, and clear semantic HTML structures.</p>

            <p class="mt-6">By incorporating these trends, designers can create websites that are not only visually appealing but also highly functional, engaging, and future-proof.</p>
