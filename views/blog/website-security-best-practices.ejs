        <h1 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-extrabold text-gray-900 leading-tight mb-6">Website Security Best Practices</h1>

        <div class="prose prose-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed max-w-none prose-red">
            <p class="mb-4">In an era of increasing cyber threats, ensuring the security of your website is paramount. A compromised website can lead to data breaches, reputational damage, and significant financial losses. Implementing robust security measures is crucial for protecting your business and your users. Here are essential website security best practices:</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">1. Use HTTPS (SSL/TLS Certificate)</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Encrypt all data transferred between your website and its users by implementing an SSL/TLS certificate. HTTPS provides a secure connection, builds trust with visitors, and is a ranking factor for search engines. Many hosting providers offer free SSL certificates (e.g., Let's Encrypt).</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">2. Keep Software Updated</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Regularly update your Content Management System (CMS), themes, plugins, and all server-side software (e.g., PHP, Node.js, databases). Outdated software often contains vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. Automate updates where possible, but always test them in a staging environment first.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">3. Strong Passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Enforce strong, unique passwords for all user accounts, especially for administrators. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for administrative logins to add an extra layer of security, making it significantly harder for unauthorized users to gain access even if they have the password.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">4. Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF)</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">A Web Application Firewall (WAF) filters and monitors HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet. It protects your website from common attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and DDoS attacks by blocking malicious traffic before it reaches your server.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">5. Regular Backups</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Perform regular and automated backups of your entire website, including files and databases. Store these backups in a secure, off-site location. In case of a security incident or data loss, a recent backup allows you to restore your website quickly and minimize downtime.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">6. Secure Coding Practices</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">For custom web applications, adhere to secure coding practices. Validate all user input, sanitize data, and use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information, and implement proper error handling to prevent information disclosure.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">7. Limit File Uploads and Permissions</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">If your website allows file uploads, restrict file types and sizes, and scan uploaded files for malware. Set strict file permissions on your server to prevent unauthorized access, modification, or execution of sensitive files and directories.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">8. Monitor for Security Threats</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Actively monitor your website for suspicious activity, malware, and vulnerabilities. Use security scanning tools, intrusion detection systems, and regularly review server logs. Promptly address any alerts or anomalies to prevent major security breaches.</p>

            <p class="mt-6">By prioritizing website security and consistently implementing these best practices, you can significantly reduce your risk of cyberattacks, protect your data, and maintain the trust of your users.</p>
